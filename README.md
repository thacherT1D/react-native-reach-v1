**Overview:** This project has evolved over time -- initially I jumped into wire-framing and prototyping and then realized that I wasn't even sure I was answering the right question. I took a step back and found a partner to help me conduct some user testing to guide the process. She is a diabetic educator and type 1 diabetes advocate in Costa Rica ([Find her on Twitter at Diabetica Solutions](https://twitter.com/diabeticasolut)). Currently we in are reviewing the surveys and interview feedback for input into the next round of wireframing/prototyping.

**Problem:** Basal tests are terrible.

**Hypothesis:** If they're terrible for me, they're probably even worse for people without the CGM and insulin pump technology

**Objective:** Find a way to make basal tests more friendly/approachable for the larger population of type 1 diabetics who do not have access to continuous glucose monitoring technology

**Initial Prototype:** [InVision Prototype](https://invis.io/7EBJ9JT35)

**User Research and Interviews**
- [Interview and Research Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hp4Gvjp-TXoEwgcG22V9a7LGZztgApuC/view?usp=sharing)
- [Google Form Interview Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a6OhXmZsvNAxwDLJDELmNKBmOUjDkDjMkslkBY2Fwnw/edit)

**Build:** This build will be delayed until the input from the user interviews is included in the prototype and design

**Next Steps:**
- Review interview feedback with Dani
- Determine if follow-up or additional interviews are required
- Wireframe and Prototype with new information
- Request feedback on prototype (iterate)
- Build with React-native
- Test with alpha and beta users
- Publish app
- Educate Diabetic Educators and Consultants to help guide their patients use of the application
